This equipped us with basic knowledge about using bash and linux comamnds to solve the problems.

**Week 2 task** (task2.sh) is more interesting and I gained more knowledge.

Pick any 3 softwares from this list (https://github.com/HackBio-Internship/wale-home-tasks/blob/main/softwares.txt): You can further sub-divide your team to handle each software

Set up a conda (anaconda, miniconda or mini forge) environment on your terminal.

Downloads some (>2) sample datasets from here: https://github.com/josoga2/yt-dataset/tree/main/dataset

Implement the three software on the downloaded files (sample datasets) and send all outputs to the output folder.

To execute the script (.sh) in your terminal you can use the bash or ./sh command
bash stage_zero_task.sh
